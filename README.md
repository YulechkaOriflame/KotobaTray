# KotobaTray

A small desktop utility built with **PySide6** that helps with Japanese learning:  
- Displaying stickers with custom vocabulary (stickers).  
- Translating text automatically from the clipboard. You need only to copy text.  
- On-the-fly translations with copy-back support.  

It lives in the system tray, and you can toggle windows on/off at any time.
